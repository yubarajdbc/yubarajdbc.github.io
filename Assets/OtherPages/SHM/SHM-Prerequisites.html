            <u>Point</u>: A point is that which has position but no magnitude. <br>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:80%">
              Basically what it means is that the only property that a point has is its position.
              It has no property called length or area or volume â€“ it only has position
              (similar to the case that a 'colour' has no taste,
              it has only the property of 'colour' like green, red etc.; <br>
              or like the case that a 'sunset' has no mass, it can have time or brightness values
              but it is meaningless to ask for the mass of a sunset). <br>
              If you find the above difficult, think of a <b>point</b> as a very very small circle
              (which becomes samller when you try to zoom in on it)

            Try to zoom in on the point shown in the next slide as a blue circle or dot.
            You will find that although you are zooming in, the size of the dot does not change because it is a point
            and it is not supposed to have a 'size'.
            the dot is used for our convenience to locate the point, because an actual theoretical point will not be
            visible to us.
            <br>
            You will also notice numbers associated with the point given in brackets.
            The position of a single entity in an infinite universe is again meaningless
            (try to imagine a point in empty space,
            there is no meaning in saying that it is here or it is there as we cannot say anything about its position
            because we have no landmark/marker/reference to compare it with).
            Thus, if we need to specify position of a point, we have to specify it with respect to a reference
            i.e. another point which we take to be fixed for all time unlike our original point which can move.
            This fixed point or landmark is the origin (the point 0 in the graph).

            <u>Line Segment</u>: A straight line segment is a collection of points (called locus) along the
            straight path between two points. It has only the property of length, it does not have any width

          <p class="JusN80">
            We can associate the concept of dimension to geometric objects
            (similar to the idea that we can associate brightness or darkness to colour values.
            Example: yellow can be considered as bright whereas brown can be considered as a
            dark colour).
            <br><br>
            You will be surpised to know that there are many ways of defining dimension,
            but that is not relevant for now. We will be non-committal at this point and
            be guided by intuition.

            Three points that do not lie on a single line cannot be contained in one dimensional space,

            Similarly, two lines which are not on top of each other cannot be contained in one dimensional space and

              to <em>three dimensional</em> space to make such an arrangment possible.

            In your interactive exploration of a triangle in the previous slide, you must have noticed that when you
            move one of the points or vertices of a triangle, then the value of all angles (or at least two angles)
            change; this shows that the value of the angles of a triangle are connected.<br>
            This connection is sometimes expressed as the fact that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is $
            180^\circ$. <br>
            If the angles are connected, then it is reasonable to ask if the length of the line segments (called sides)

          It is found that the complicated relationship among the sides of a triangle becomes simple for one particular
          type of triangle: the so-called right triangle.
          <p style="color:rgb(250, 182, 216)">This simpler relationship is the famous Pythagorean theorem (also called

            A <em>right triangle</em> is a triangle in which one angle is $ 90^\circ$. <br>
            Since, the total is to be $180^\circ$, then obviously the other two are less than $90^\circ$.<br>
            The longest side of a right triangle is called the hypotenuse; the side opposite to $90^\circ$ angle is
            called the opposite side and the remaining side is called the adjacent side.

          There appears to be a curious relationship between the ratio of the sides and the angles of a right-triangle.
          <br>
          This relationship cannot be expressed by any form of finite polynomial function (or any primitive/simple
          function) and therefore we invent a new functions.
          <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 70%;">
            </p>
            Since there are three sides let us represent them by $h, p$ and $b$. <br>
            $h$-for hypotenuse;<br>
            $p$ for opposite side (it is weird to use symbol $o$ and $p$ is sometimes also called perpendicular);<br>
            and, finally $b$ for the adjacent side (also called the known as the base hence $b$). <br>
          </div>

        <section class="center" style="text-align: justify;">
          In how many ways can three things ($h, p$ and $b$) be arranged taking two at a time (order does not matter)?
          <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 70%;">
            </p>
            Let us find out <br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                $\quad p$ and $h$
              </li>
              <li>
                $\quad b$ and $h$
              </li>
              <li>
                $\quad p$ and $b$ <br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Thus, there are three ways. <br>
            Of course we could have use the mathematical method of combination and permutations but why bother for such
            a simple problem that can be solved by hand.

          Each of the three ratios that we got previously is given a name and is considered a function (just like
          $f(x)=x^2$ is a function)
          <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 70%;line-height: 2em;">
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                the ratio $\frac{p}{h}$ is called sine abbreviated as <em>sin</em>>.
              </li>
              <li>
                the ratio $\frac{b}{h}$ is called cosine abbreviated as <em>cos</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                the ratio $\frac{p}{b}$ is called tangent abbreviated as <em>tan</em>.<br><br>
              </li>
            </ol>

          </div>
          <div style="font-size:70%;">
            Remember that the ratio of the sides of a right-triangle depends only on the angle formed by the two sides,
            hence, <em>sin, cos</em> and <em>tan</em> are functions of angle.<br>
            Just like an unknown number is usually denoted by $x$, an unknown angle is usually denote by the Greek
            letter $\theta$.

        <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -->
        <section class="center" style="text-align: justify;">
          The three ratios <em>sin, cos</em> and <em>tan</em> are called trigonometric ratios (and when used with an
          unknown/variable angle $\theta$ are called trigonometric functions).
          <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 70%;line-height: 2em;">
            Thus, <br>
            $sin(\theta) = \frac{p}{h} \quad \quad$

            $cos(\theta) = \frac{b}{h} \quad \quad$

            $tan(\theta) = \frac{p}{b}$ <br><br>
          </div>

          <div style="font-size:70%;">
            Note that if we forget about the sides for some time, then we have just got 3 brand new functions.<br>
            Example:let $f(\theta) = sin(\theta)$.<br>
            Here, $f(\theta)$ is a function of $\theta$ just like $f(x) = x^2$ is a function of $x$.

          Now I come to the end of this section and reveal a well-known secret!
          <div style="text-align: justify;font-size: 70%;">
            <em>The two functions - sine and consine that we just defined are the only simple functions that are
              repetitive in nature </em> <br>
            that is, on slowly changing the value of $\theta$, the value of $sin(\theta)$ as well as $ cos(\theta)$
            repeats after a certain interval. <br>
            It turns out that any other (no matter how complicated) repetitive function can be always written as a sum
            of sine and consine functions: this is the basis for Fourier series/analysis and we will not go into that
            for the time being.
