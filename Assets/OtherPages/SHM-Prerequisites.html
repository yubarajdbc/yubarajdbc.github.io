    <u>Point</u>: A point is that which has position but no magnitude. <br>
    <br><br>
    <p style="font-size:80%">
    Basically what it means is that the only property that a point has is its position. 
    It has no property called length or area or volume â€“ it only has position 
    (similar to the case that a 'colour' has no taste, 
    it has only the property of 'colour' like green, red etc.; <br>
    or like the case that a 'sunset' has no mass, it can have time or brightness values 
    but it is meaningless to ask for the mass of a sunset). <br>
    If you find the above difficult, think of a <b>point</b> as a very very small circle 
    (which becomes samller when you try to zoom in on it)
    </p>
    </div>
</section>
 <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -->    
 <section>
  <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 70%;">
    Try to zoom in on the point shown in the next slide as a blue circle or dot.
    You will find that although you are zooming in, the size of the dot does not change because it is a point 
    and it is not supposed to have a 'size'. 
    the dot is used for our convenience to locate the point, because an actual theoretical point will 
    not be visible to us. 
    <br><br>
    You will also notice numbers associated with the point given in brackets. 
    The position of a single entity in an infinite universe is again meaningless 
    (try to imagine a point in empty space,
    there is no meaning in saying that it is here or it is there as we cannot say anything about its position 
    because we have no landmark/marker/reference to compare it with). 
    Thus, if we need to specify position of a point, we have to specify it with respect to a reference 
    i.e. another point which we take to be fixed for all time unlike our original point which can move. 
    This fixed point or landmark is the origin (the point 0 in the graph).

    <u>Line Segment</u>:  A straight line segment is a collection of points (called locus) along the 
             straight path between two points. It has only the property of length, it does not have any width
             or thickness. 
             Later we will see that a few other properties can be assigned to it depending on context.<br>
    <p style="font-size:80%">
      To go from the concept of a point to a line, imagine line as a large 
      collection of points next to each other. The idea of length cannot be simplied further 
      and it is assumed that everyone agrees what it means
      (a straight path has the shortest distance in Euclidean goemetry).

  <h3> Dimension of geometrical objects </h3>
  <p class="JusN80">
    We can associate the concept of dimension to geometric objects
     (similar to the idea that we can associate brightness or darkness to colour values. 
     Example: yellow can be considered as bright whereas brown can be considered as a 
     dark colour).
     <br><br>
     You will be surpised to know that there are many ways of defining dimension, 
     but that is not relevant for now. We will be non-committal at this point and 
     be guided by intuition.

    A point is zero dimensional.
    <p style="font-size:80%">Since a point does not have any size, no space is required to 
      completely contain it and hence it is zero dimensional. 
      Please understand I am over-simplifying.  
    </p>   <br>
     A line is one dimensional.
     <p style="font-size:80%">
      The <i>kind</i> of space required to completely contain a single line, 
      line segment or ray is called one-dimensional.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------  -->     
<section>
  <div c style="text-align: justify">
    Two lines which are not on top of each other cannot be contained in one dimension, 
hence, we invent a new type of space called two dimensional space 
which can contain two lines. 
<p style="font-size:80%">
  It turns out that any number of lines can be accomodated in two dimensional space
  and therefore any geometrical shape that is made of lines can be accomodated 
  in two dimensions.
</p>
<br>
Then how do we get to three dimensions? <br>
The answer lies in angles. <br>
<p style="font-size:80%">
(a third dimension is required if you try to 
make three lines such that the angle between any two lines is the same; 
this is not possible in two dimensions) </p>

  <u>Angle</u>:  A plane angle is the inclination of two lines to one another in a plane.
  <p style="font-size:80%">
    Note that parallel lines are taken to have zero angle and non-parallel 
    lines will always meet a some point. <br>
    Inclination between two lines can be understood as a measure of 
    how close together the two lines are; because a line is composed of many points, 
    there is directly obvious unique answer. <br><br>
    Two lines inclined in such a way that it has the most symmetry (without being parallel) 
    is taken to have an angle of 90 degrees. 
    Defining 1 degree also requires the help of symmetry.
